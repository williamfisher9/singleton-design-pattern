## Singleton Design Pattern
- It is a Creational Design Pattern.
- A single class is responsible for creating one single object. 
- This class provides a way to access its only object without instantiating an object of the class.
- This class has its constructor as private and has a static instance of itself.
- This class provides a static method to get its static instance to outside world.
